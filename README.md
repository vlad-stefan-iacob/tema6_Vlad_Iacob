# HTML & a Bit of JS Homework


Requirements explanations:
1.a. Both dropdown lists are made using static arrays in JavaScript. One feature implemented here is that once you select an option from first dropdown (Leave From), that option becomes disabled in the second dropdown list (To). This was made to avoid having the same location in both options.
1.b. At the top of the page there are 3 different images which change automatically using Bootstrap carousel.

2. The 3 CSS animations are:
a. An icon with a car which moves in a zig-zag keyframe between the 2 lines of cards;
b. When you press the search button, a Loading icon will pop up (which is rotating) and remains active for 3 seconds;
c. When you double-click the copyright text, an image with an explosion will appear which have an animated effect similarly to an explosion;

3. The “Search” button will shuffle all the cards and show them in another order. This is made randomly.

4. The easter egg is when you double-click the copyright text, an image with an explosion will appear which have an animated effect similarly to an explosion.

5. I have used Bootstrap and Flex to implement all the requirements.
